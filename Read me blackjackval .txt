Blackjackval XML 

This is a small xml  I created to work with RicX Blackjack for Valentine. 
Itâ€™s FREE, try it on you server. 
- If you donâ€™t have RicX blackjack and the script below is not added to your (Ricx Blackjack) config, you can still use the map but there will be no table, chair or dealer. Just an empty space in the corner of the small saloon. All decor will still be placed. 
Enjoy ðŸ¥ƒ

Download and extract XML file. 
Place file in your resources  
Add the code below to your Ricx blackjack config
Ensure blackjackval 
Restart your server

Here is the script to add to your ricx blackjack config
